# CodeDisclosed
This repository has all the MATLAB code used in all the videos uploaded on the Code Disclosed YouTube channel ([https://www.youtube.com/@CodeDisclosed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5GOqkt-9FeB_-dSPn5_FUA))

Channel Description

Channel Aim:
--------------
This channel focuses on explaining and writing codes using major computational methods with emphasis on their implementation of several science and engineering problems. MATLAB is the primary programming software used to write all codes. 

Videos Content:
---------------
Each video starts with a short presentation explaining the problem and how it is solved numerically and then we move on to MATLAB to go step by step with programming the solution and then assessing it. 

Target Audience & Required Skills:
----------------------------------
This channel is for students from various STEM backgrounds whether they are still in their undergraduate or graduate university years. These videos do not intend to teach writing codes in MATLAB, therefore a basic knowledge of its commands would be preferable.   

Timing:
------------
Every Saturday a new video will be uploaded.

Enjoy!
